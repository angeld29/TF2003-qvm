Do not use double in mods, qvm does not support it.

Do not modify progdefs.h and g_public.h.

Use PROG_TO_EDICT, EDICT_TO_PROG for working with (gedict_t)->s.v entity
fields (like .owner, .enemy).

Map entities are described in g_spawn.c in tables:
field_t         fields[]
spawn_t         spawns[]

Missile spawn requires g_globalvars.newmis set.
