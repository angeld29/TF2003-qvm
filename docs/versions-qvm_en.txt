QuakeWorld TeamFortress 2003 (QVM/DLL/SO Versions)
by [sd] angel for MTFL

TF2003-QVM is a first QW-mod ever written in pure C.  During porting from
QuakeC some code was significantly optimized and even rewritten from scratch.
That is why there could be errors not found in original TF2003.  All of them
will be fixed upon discovery.  We are working hard on it :).  After the most
debugging will be complete, there will be new functios added (there is a long
TODO list aready).
